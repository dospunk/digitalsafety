# Digital Safety for Protesters

## Encrypt your communications

### Why

The police have the ability to intercept your text messages and calls with a device called a Stingray. While it hasn't been
confirmed that stingrays are in use, there is also no way to confirm that they're not. It is also possible that if you are
arrested, the police could get a search warrent to obtain your text message reccords from your cellphone carrier. 

### How

Download the app Signal, and encourage your friends to as well. Signal is an encrypted messaging app, so even if the police
do intercept your messages, they won't be able to read them. I like signal because the store almost 0 data about your account,
while other encrypted messaging apps still store things like your contacts list or your groups on  their server.

## Blur your images and scrub your metadata

### Why

Police use images of protesters to identify them after the protest has ended. You might be snitching on someone without even knowing it! Similarly, metadata may contain information like time the photo was taken or the location it was taken.
