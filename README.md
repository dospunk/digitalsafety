# Digital Safety

The purpose of this repository is to compile information on how protesters can avoid endangering themselves through technology. In this age of mass surveilance, many people don't realize just how much information their devices and their online activities can give away. 

## Print-outs

Since using your phone at a protest is unadvisable (See "Donâ€™t let your phone give you away"), I've made it possible to print this webpage as a booklet. zine.pdf is set up to be printed using the booklet feature on software like Adobe Reader. zine-mini.pdf is set up to be printed out and then each sheet cut in half to save paper and be pocket-sized. Setting this one up for printing is harder, and I'm working on a way to get it automated.

### Generating print-outs yourself 

If you want to generate the print-outs yourself, you'll need [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and a LaTeX installation that includes pdflatex. I use [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/). Then all you need to do is run `make`. You'll probably need to install some LaTeX packages the first time you run the command, which MiKTeX can handle for you.
